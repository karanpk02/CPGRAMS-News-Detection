"Amidst the heat and dust of the ongoing electioneering of the state Assembly elections, a critical rail reform plan was pushed through this month.

Engineering Service officers will no longer retain their preponderance and elevated status in the bureaucratic hierarchy. As an outcome, specialised tasks such as track building or locomotive manufacture and upkeep are likely to get outsourced in coming years. In short, the old template for conducting rail business has been discarded, while there is uncertainty about what the future holds. The situation - understandably so - has caused serious heartburn and apprehensions in the minds of the existing Class-A category of rail officers - estimated cadre strength of 4500 personnel. ",yes

The flip side, though, is a historic jump in the cost of shipping goods from India to destinations abroad. According to data compiled by the website Indian Transport and Logistics News, the cost of shipping a ‘container’ from Kochi to Europe’s Rotterdam port has increased by 873% between March 2020 and August 2021.
